Very draft version :)
Ruby version: 1.9
Gems required: sqlite3, nokogiri, open-uri, htmlentities

Basic Rake steps workflow (run rake -T for the whole list of available tasks)

# Create cache folders and SQLite DB
rake setup:init

# OPTIONAL step: by default whole Switzerland timetables are fetched
#           if you want it only for a smaller area, run the following command
#           'bounds' parameter contains 4 values, separated by comma:
#               corner SW longitude,corner SW latitude,corner NE longitude,corner NE latitude
rake station:set_bounds bounds=8.53,47.41,8.61,47.46

# Discovers the stations in the studied area
rake station:fetch
